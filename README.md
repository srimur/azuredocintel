 It retrieves the userâ€™s recent call history from JSONL files in Azure Blob Storage, analyzes key metrics like Wi-Fi signal strength, packet loss, jitter, device glitch rates, CPU usage, and more to detect the root cause of poor call quality. Based on this analysis, it produces two outputs: (1) a detailed technical JSON report summarizing network, device, and system-level insights, including optional AI Search matches for known issues (e.g., problematic headset models or subnets), and (2) a concise, GPT-generated user notification that explains the issue clearly and provides only the most applicable, actionable steps to fix or prevent it. These outputs can be returned via API or pushed to Teams or email depending on the integration.
