Deploy lightweight agents on each user’s device and at key network nodes to continuously track packet loss, latency, jitter, and media‑stream health.

Detect anomalies in real time using built‑in thresholds (e.g., packet loss >2 %, latency >150 ms).

Trigger automated fixes at the edge—such as rerouting traffic over a secondary path, restarting the network interface, or adjusting codec settings—without waiting for central intervention.

Notify the user instantly via an in‑app alert (or email/SMS) that a remediation step was taken and the connection is restoring.

Log all events and outcomes to a central system so support teams can review trends, escalate unresolved issues, and continuously refine anomaly thresholds.
